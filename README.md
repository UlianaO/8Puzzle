# 8Puzzle
The program solves a popular “8-puzzle” game using multiple searching algorithms(BS, DS, Dijkstra) to find the shortest path to the goal configuration of the puzzle. The goal of the program is to demonstrate and analyze the performance of the searching algorithms.

This  [report](8Puzzle%20Using%20BFS%2C%20DFS%2C%20Dijkstra/Report.pdf) describes the implementation, rules, processes and restrictions of the project.
